Rainfall Prediction Web App

This is a machine learning-powered rainfall prediction application that uses weather features such as pressure, dew point, humidity, cloud cover, sunshine, wind direction, and wind speed to classify whether it will rain or not.


The project features a full-stack pipeline from data preprocessing to deployment-ready integration using a trained `Random Forest` model. It also includes a smart system that detects the user's location and pulls real-time weather data for prediction.
